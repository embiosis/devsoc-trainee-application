# 24T2 DevSoc Trainee Program Application
A simple website for applying to the DevSoc Trainee Program (24T2).

In order to apply for the program, I created a profile page with the theme of 'Circles'.

I created my page with four distinct sections:
- About Me
- Fav Games
- Projects
- Links

The page contains the following features:
- A functional navigation bar
- An autoscrolling, infinite carousel for games
- Animated GIFs which appear when game images are hovered
- Heavy use of circles and circular borders for images
- An interactive circle logo / favicon which toggles between light and dark themes
- Repeated, rounded card design for games and projects
- Animated, expanding project cards with links that appear when hovered
- Responsive hover effects when interacting with buttons and links
  
While the majority of this page was created using pure HTML and CSS, a little bit of JavaScript was implemented to change between dark and light mode themes.

_Hi there! Thanks for visiting this repository. It's still a work in progress, so there might be more content added later._
This is my first proper website so I'd appreciate any feedback!
